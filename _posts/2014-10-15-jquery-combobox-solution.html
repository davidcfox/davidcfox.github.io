title: jQuery Combobox Solution

<div>
I needed a simple jQuery combobox for a project today.  After a failed attempt at using the jQuery UI autocomplete, I found this beauty: <a href="http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/">http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/</a></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It works great and does exactly what I need.  In the future, this will be my choice of plugin for this purpose.</div>
