title: Prevent Submit/Enter Key from Refreshing Page in IE with KnockoutJS
---

<p>Today, I built a very simple calculator using KnockoutJS to handle the calculator events and found a strange issue in Internet Explorer when pressing the enter key while in the input for the calculator.  This is my first Knockout project, so I  am not too familiar with it at this point, but I found this helpful handler that allowed me to catch the enter key press and prevent it from firing.</p>
<pre><code> ko.bindingHandlers.returnKey = {
 init: function(element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor, viewModel) {
         ko.utils.registerEventHandler(element, 'keydown', function(evt) {
                 if (evt.keyCode === 13) {
                     evt.preventDefault();
                     return false;
                 }
         });
     }
};
</code></pre>
<p>I placed the above bindingHandler above my ViewModel and I placed the following on the input field that I was wanting to suppress the event on:</p>
<p>I am sure there is a better way to do this and when I find it on future projects, I will update this.  </p>
