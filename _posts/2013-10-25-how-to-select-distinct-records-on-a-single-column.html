title: How To Select Distinct Records on a Single Column
---

<p>Today I needed to be able to retrieve a list of records that was distinct based on one of the columns in the table.  Unfortunately, it took a while to find a suitable solution.  If you are using Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and up, you can make use of this simple function to get a record set that is distinct based on a single column:</p>
<p>WITH temp AS<br />
(<br />
SELECT *,<br />
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY [DISTINCT COLUMN NAME] ORDER BY [DISTINCT COLUMN NAME]) AS rn<br />
FROM [YOURSERVER].[DBO].[YOUR TABLE]<br />
)<br />
select * from temp where rn=1</p>
